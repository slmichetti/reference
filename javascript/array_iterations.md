## Array Loops

Variety of ways to iterate over data in an array. 

### for loops

* very versatile
* give you complete control over looping process
	* defining where you start/stop
	* whether you want to skip over values
	* whether you want to break out early using 'break' statement

### forEach(func)

* access each element directly
	* without needing an index
* gives you a concise way to loop over an array if you're looping over every element from start to finish
* less versatility than for looop
* no index needed for the element

### map(func)

* define a callback function taht performs an operation on each element of the array
* difference is map() returns a new array
