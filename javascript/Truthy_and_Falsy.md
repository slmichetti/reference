### Truthy and Falsy

Every value in JavaScript has an inherent boolean value. When that value is evaluated in the context of a boolean expression, the value will be transformed into that inherent boolean value.

## Falsy Values

A value is **falsy** if it converts to false when evaluated in a boolean context. 
  Ex: An empty string "" is falsy because "" evaluates to false. 

**Falsy Values**
1. the Boolean value false
2. the null type
3. the undefined type
4. the number 0
5. the empty string ""
6. the odd value NaN (stands for "not a number")


## Truthy Values

A value is **truthy** if it converts to true when evaluated in a boolean context. 
	Ex: The number 1 is truthy because 1 evaluates to true.

** If it's not in the list of falsy values, then it's truthy!**
